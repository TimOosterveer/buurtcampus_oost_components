# Plantswap

<h2 align="center"> 🍀Buurtcampus-Oost Plantswap website🍀</h2>
<br>
For the Stekjesbieb, we have developed an amazing plant swap website. 🌿
Visitors can explore plants and learn more about the plant swap initiative. Upon visiting our website, you'll be greeted with an informative homepage. Here, we explain what plant swapping is and how you can participate in this initiative yourself. Furthermore, you can view all available cuttings on the website and find detailed information about each cutting on the individual detail page. 🌱

Additionally, Stekjesbieb offers workshops where you can learn the best practices for caring for your cuttings. 🌸 These workshops can also be found on our website. Finally, on our contact page, you can find all the information about our location and the possibility to get in touch with us. 📌
